"""Void — a tiny voice-first shell for Claude Code.

Local server (127.0.0.1 only) that:
  * serves the Void UI
  * records the mic itself (parecord / pw-record / arecord — no browser mic permissions needed)
    with a little voice-activity detector, and transcribes it with faster-whisper
  * runs `claude -p --output-format stream-json` and streams events back
  * speaks replies with piper (or espeak-ng as a fallback)

    "space\"); Void reads it aloud when asking the user for permission. "
    "When a task needs you to see the user's screen (they mention something on it, or you need to check what happened), "

### Talk to your code

Void is a little orb that floats on your desktop. Tell him what you want, and he gets
[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to do it in your project. Then he tells you how it went.

- 🎙️ **Just say it.** "Hey Void, fix the failing tests."
- 👀 **Watch him work.** He holds up a tiny terminal so you see every step.
- 🔒 **Private.** Your voice never leaves your computer.
- ✨ **Out of your way.** No app window, no taskbar button. Just him.
- 🔝 **Or tuck him into your screen's edge.** Push him to any edge and he becomes a MacBook-style notch.

## Install

> **You need [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) first.** Install it, then run `claude` once in a
> terminal to sign in. Void is the voice and face; Claude Code does the work.

> **On a Mac?** You're in the right place: this `macos` branch of [ohshitgorillas/void](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/void/tree/macos) is the Mac version. Jump to [macOS](#macos).

### Linux: one-line install

Paste it into a terminal:

The line above picks the right package for your system. On a distro without one, it installs from source.

**Or download a package yourself** (.deb · .rpm · Arch)

<p align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/PLAYER99-void/void/releases/latest"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu_%2F_Debian-.deb-E95420?style=for-the-badge&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white" alt="Download the .deb for Ubuntu and Debian"></a><br>

</p>

Download the one for your distro from the [latest release](https://github.com/PLAYER99-void/void/releases/latest), then:

| | |
|---|---|
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ubuntu_%2F_Debian-E95420?style=flat-square&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white" alt="Ubuntu / Debian"> | `sudo apt install ./void-claude_*_all.deb` |
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Fedora-51A2DA?style=flat-square&logo=fedora&logoColor=white" alt="Fedora"> | `sudo dnf install ./void-claude-*.noarch.rpm` |
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Arch_Linux-1793D1?style=flat-square&logo=archlinux&logoColor=white" alt="Arch Linux"> | `sudo pacman -U ./void-claude-*.pkg.tar.zst` |

Then `void setup` once (his voice and hearing) and `void`.

**Or from source** (git clone)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PLAYER99-void/void.git
cd void && ./install.sh
void
```

It gets the system packages for you (pacman, apt or dnf) and updates itself with `git pull`.

<sub>Gentoo or system-wide? See the <a href="docs/GUIDE.md#install-from-source">guide</a>.</sub>

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> The Mac version lives on the [`macos` branch of `ohshitgorillas/void`](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/void/tree/macos),

### macOS

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-Apple_Silicon-000000?style=flat-square&logo=apple&logoColor=white" alt="macOS on Apple Silicon">

The Mac version lives on the `macos` branch of [ohshitgorillas/void](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/void/tree/macos), a fork of Void kept up to date with the main project. It is built and tested on macOS by the fork's maintainer; the main project's author doesn't have a Mac and can't vouch for it.

**The app.** Download **Void.dmg** from the [fork's latest release](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/void/releases/latest), open it and drag **Void** into Applications. It's for Apple Silicon Macs (M1 or newer).

<sub>The app isn't notarized by Apple, so the first launch is blocked. Open <b>System Settings → Privacy & Security</b>, scroll down and click <b>Open Anyway</b> next to Void. macOS then asks to let him use the microphone: say yes.</sub>

**Or from source.**

```bash
git clone -b macos https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/void.git
cd void && ./install.sh
void
```

No system packages needed: his window, mic and speakers all come from PyPI. When macOS asks to let your terminal use the microphone or record the screen, say yes. `git pull` on the `macos` branch updates him.

## Your first two minutes

| | Do this | What happens |
|:-:|---|---|
| **1** | Start Void | He appears in the bottom-right corner. Drag him anywhere; he remembers the spot. |
| **2** | Say **"hey Void"** | His ring lights up and moves with your voice. (Or just **click** him.) |
| **3** | Ask for something | He works in the current folder. Say "switch to my project" or right-click → *folder* to change it. |
| **4** | **Right-click** him | His menu: talk, folder, history, show my screen, hover mode, settings. |
| **5** | **Push him into a screen edge** | He merges into it as a notch, with just his eyes. Click the notch for his menu (click again to close it). Drag him out to get the orb back. |

> [!TIP]
> Say **"stop"** to interrupt him, hold **Space** for push-to-talk, or just start **typing** for a text box. Press
> **Esc** to back out of anything. **Ctrl+N** (or saying "new chat") starts a fresh conversation.

## Things to try

| 💻 Coding | 🖥️ Your screen | ⚡ Instant |
|---|---|---|
| "Hey Void, run the tests" | "What's this error on my screen?" | "Timer 10 minutes" |
| "Fix the failing test" | "Explain what I copied" | "Volume up" |
| "What does this project do?" | "Watch my screen" (live view) | "Open firefox" |
| "Make the button blue" | "Did that fix the layout?" | "Remind me at 5 to call mom" |

<sub>Before running commands he asks first: say "yes", "no" or "always". Change that in Settings → Brain.</sub>

## Need help?

Run **`void doctor`** first. It checks your mic, his voice and Claude Code in a few seconds.

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| He can't hear me | Check the level meter in `void doctor`, then pick the right mic in Settings → Voice. |
| "I can't find Claude Code" | Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and run `claude` once to sign in. |
| Windows: "DLL load failed" | Install the [Visual C++ runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe), then `void restart`. |
| Something else | Right-click him → Settings → More → **Copy diagnostics**, then **Report a problem** and paste it. Or see [Troubleshooting](docs/GUIDE.md#troubleshooting). |
| Want to chat or share what you built | Join the [Void Discord](https://discord.gg/Y87KGhqbK5). |
